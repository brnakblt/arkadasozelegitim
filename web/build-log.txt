 ΓÜá Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of C:\Users\baran\Desktop\dev\arkadasozelegitim\package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles:

   Creating an optimized production build ...
 Γ¿» ERROR: This build is using Turbopack, with a `webpack` config and no `turbopack` config.
   This may be a mistake.

   As of Next.js 16 Turbopack is enabled by default and
   custom webpack configurations may need to be migrated to Turbopack.

   NOTE: your `webpack` config may have been added by a configuration plugin.

   To configure Turbopack, see https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbopack

   TIP: Many applications work fine under Turbopack with no configuration,
   if that is the case for you, you can silence this error by passing the
   `--turbopack` or `--webpack` flag explicitly or simply setting an 
   empty turbopack config in your Next config file (e.g. `turbopack: {}`).
